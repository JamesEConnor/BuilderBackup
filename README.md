# BuilderBackup
A quick script for the Unity Game Engine that will automatically build your game upon start up. Along with your game, it will also save a copy of all of your Editor scripts.

This is to be used with JetBrains DotPeek, as this package is supposed to be used as a way of "backing up" your scripts if your computer crashes, saving any files that could become corrupted inside the resulting executable. Works on Windows, Linux, and OSX 32-bit and 64-bit.

DotPeek can be downloaded here: https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windowsWeb

Instructions on how to use DotPeek are available here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/decompiler/dotPeek_Getting_Started.html

To view the script files of a Unity Executable, open the Assembly-CSharp.dll available in the \_Data\\Managed\\
