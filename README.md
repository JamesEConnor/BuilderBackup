# BuilderBackup
A quick script for the Unity Game Engine that will automatically build your game upon start up.

This is used packaged with ILSpy, as this package is suppossed to be used as a way of "backing up" your scripts if your computer crashes, saving any files that could become corrupted inside the resulting executable. Works on Windows, Linux, and OSX 32-bit and 64-bit.
